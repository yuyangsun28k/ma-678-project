```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Library
```{r, echo= FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(corrplot)

```

## Load Data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load Data
bank <- read.csv("/Users/thomas/Downloads/ma678/midterm project/datasets/bank-full.csv" , sep = ";", header = TRUE)

# Convert binary variables to 0 and 1

# Convert categorical variables to dummy variables

```

## Initital Setup

### Check NA's

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Number of NA values for each variable
na_counts <- sapply(bank, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
print(na_counts)
```

### Balance vs. Age

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Balance vs. Age
ggplot(bank, aes(x = age, y = balance)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Balance grouped by Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Balance")

```
#### Cut the age into subgroups

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bank_cutage <- bank
bank_cutage$age_group <- cut(bank_cutage$age, 
                      breaks = c(-Inf, 24, 60, Inf), 
                      labels = c("0-24", "25-60", "60+"),
                      right = TRUE)

head(bank_cutage)
table(bank_cutage$age_group)
```




### Balance vs. Duration

```{r,warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(bank, aes(x = duration, y = balance)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  xlim(0,2000) +
  ylim(0,350000) +
  labs(title = "Balance grouped by Duration",
       x = "Duration", 
       y = "Balance")
```

### Duration vs. Loan, Housing
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(bank, aes(x = as.factor(loan), y = duration)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Violin Plot of Duration by Loan Status",
       x = "Loan Status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)",
       y = "Duration")

```

### Balance vs. Loan, Housing
```{r, echo=FALSE}

### Correlation of Numeric Data
```{r}
numerical_data <- bank[sapply(bank, is.numeric)]
corr_matrix <- cor(numerical_data, use = "complete.obs")
corrplot(corr_matrix, method = "circle")
```

### Check pday, poutcome
```{r}
summary(bank$pdays)
sum(is.na(bank$pdays))
sum(bank$pdays == -1)  # or any other special code

summary(bank$campaign)
table(bank$poutcome)

```

```{r}
model_pdays <- glm(y ~ pdays, data = bank, family = binomial)
model_campaign <- glm(y ~ campaign, data = bank, family = binomial)
model_poutcome <- glm(y ~ poutcome, data = bank, family = binomial)
summary(model_pdays)
summary(model_campaign)
summary(model_poutcome)
```


## Logistic Regression

```{r}
# Splitting data into training and test sets
set.seed(55)
training_rows <- createDataPartition(bank$y, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
train_data <- bank[training_rows, ]
test_data <- bank[-training_rows, ]

# Build logistic regression model
model <- glm(y ~ ., data = train_data, family = binomial)
summary(model)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data, type = "response")

# Convert predictions to binary format
predicted_class <- ifelse(predictions > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Confusion matrix and accuracy
confusionMatrix <- confusionMatrix(factor(predicted_class), factor(test_data$y))
print(confusionMatrix)

# ROC and AUC

roc_result <- roc(test_data$y, predictions)
auc(roc_result)
plot(roc_result)

# Build logistic regression model with two categorical predictors
model_categorical <- glm(y ~ default + job, data = train_data, family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_categorical)


```

## Multilevel regression
```{r}
# Convert categorical variables to factors if they are not already
bank$education <- as.factor(bank$education)
bank$marital <- as.factor(bank$marital)
bank$loan <- as.factor(bank$loan)
bank$housing <- as.factor(bank$housing)

# Build the model
# Replace 'cluster_var' with your actual clustering variable
model <- glmer(y ~ age + education + marital + balance + loan + housing + (1 | duration), 
               data = bank, 
               family = binomial)

# View the model summary
summary(model)
```


```{r}
